# What is this?

Collection of utilities I've created for managing photos that I back up in various cloud services. Most modules self explanatory, except 'photo-converter' which takes a photo as input, resizes to 1080x1920, adds a blured background copy if the original is in a different aspect ratio, adds date and location as overlay text.

Note for google photos uploader: if you upload a new image with the same filename, it doesn't overwrite the old one, it just adds a new one with the same filename.
